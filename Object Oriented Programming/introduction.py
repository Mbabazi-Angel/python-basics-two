#Object Oriented Programming
#object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

#Advantages
#OOP is faster and easier to execute
#OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
#OOP helps to keep the code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
#OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time 
#A constructor is a special type of function called to create an object. 
#It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.
#i.e __init__()

#Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
#A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

#class/models/resources (what is the important information)
#User;
#ID, first_name, last_name, email, contact, password, image
